# Why is your Username Copenhagen To London?
A long time ago, I met my girlfriend on an online forum, called Personality cafe.
She is Polish, I'm Danish, she moved to London to study and work. So the username comes from the trip I travel every now and again to see her.
As of 2024 I'm 29 years old. Short, half czech, half danish man, with a high IQ, I've been tested to have x >= 158 IQ.

I've done nearly everything between heaven and earth. I originally wanted to be an artist, so I went to a design school and managed to win an award and travel to india to participate with my project and two friends.

I've taken part in the academy for talented youths, the youth organization for the natural sciences and the UNF physics summer camp 2016. 
I've travelled to the US, asia, arabia and Europe, where I frequently to and from Copenhagen, Denmark(my home), Gdynia, Poland(girlfriends family home) and London, UK(girlfriends current home)
I've two younger brothers, all of us, including my parents work in IT in some way. It goes all the way back to my grandparents, my grandmother doing technical drawings on the old AutoCad software and my grandfather owning one of Denmarks first computers and electronics stores.

In recent years, I've studied math, but failed, because I couldn't pass the course Measures and Integrals. I've worked 4 years for MentorDenmark, 2 years for Denmarks Statistics, 1 year for Lån & Spar Bank and 1 year for DJØF. My most recent relevant position was with LD Pensions, for about 8 months.
After this I've returned to working as a cleaner and store clerk, which I've also done a lot of earlier in my life. It's hard, but it has built me up to be very resilient and incredibly efficient. I work with IT out of passion, rather than out of a wish for money. It is not uncommon, that I'll be working long hours into the night to research or to reach the level of quality I desire.




Working as a cleaner and store clerk at the moment. So only very little will happen here.\
For those few who arrive on my page looking to hire me.
My latest career oriented job was with LD Pensions, developing their various Python and analytics related tools.
Python packages, API connections, Database connections, risk frameworks and more like that.
Prior to that I've also worked with a small bank doing data quality on IRB, tutoring in Python and VBA for a workers union and everything IT needed for the economics department of Denmarks Statistics.
I'm a member of Mensa and I've been tested to have x >= 158 IQ. I can do whatever you need, I'm dedicated and I work fast/learn faster, but I cannot stand shitty bosses.
pay me shit and bagels, I'll get the job done good and fast. But treat me bad and I'll leave instanteously.

### Programming?
My main language of choice is Python at the moment, mostly because of the opensource nature of it.
My preferred language by far is C++, it's sharp, fast and the argumentation of it is just like my mind.

Doing coding work in:
- coding in Python using JupyterLab and Spyder, to do quick mockups.
- coding in C++ with Visual Studio, when I want to feel good or do proper work.
- coding in R with RStudio, for studies.
- coding in VBA/VBS, when my bosses hasn't seen the light of day yet.


### What did I specialize in?
My work experience has been focused around two very different topics namely; buy-side risk management and data engineering.

I've worked with SQL databases since I was 13. Yes, 13 isn't an exaggeration here. I had my own WoW private server, I worked out how to set up a database, run the private wow server instance and open my router ports so my friends could connect to my computer to run their wow clients on the private server. I learned how to run SQL queries, how to setup configuration files and how to run backups with development and production environments.

My family was particularly hard hit during the financial crisis, hence why buy-side risk management has been important to me ever since I started looking into finance.
I've worked with Denmarks statistics, helping them keep track of their finances and economics and with LD Pensions I got the opportunity to unfold part of my dedication to the subject. I've worked on risk measures and compliance measures for their entire investment analysis section. V@R, CV@R, liquidity risk, margin call mitigation, interest rate risk and forex risk are a few subjects I was asked to looking into and develop tools for.


Increasing my proficiency in:
- learning statistical analysis and advanced probability theory
- learning Actuarial science
- learning Quantitative finance, focusing on Credit Risk and capital reserving


## Projects
- Working on collecting knowledge to add to my [Knowledgebase](https://github.com/CopenhagenToLondon/Knowledgebase)
- Developing my Stochastics processes package
- Developing a large collected package called TMRW for various purposes, such as data extraction, data analysis and quantitative analysis

## Learning goals
- Learn to construct python packages with several sub packages.
- Learn to develop LLMs from scratch, so as to not rely on python packages.
- Learn mean field games, to make it part of python package on stochastic processes.


## Contact and connections
For a moment, due to low income, I am unable to keep my personal website running.
