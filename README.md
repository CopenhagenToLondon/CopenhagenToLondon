# Under construction, please bear with me.

The username comes from the flight route I take every now and again.

I am currently:

- coding in Python using JupyterLab
- coding in C++ with Visual Studio
- working on several projects at the same time.


## Reading list

## Contact and connections
Soon enough I'll get enough savings to reopen my personal website.
