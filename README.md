# Under construction, please bear with me.

The username comes from the flight route I take every now and again.

I am currently:

- ðŸ–¥ coding in Python using Pycharm and VSCode
- âœ¨ Working on this project [Understanding Quantitative Finance](https://quantgirluk.github.io/Understanding-Quantitative-Finance/intro.html)






## Reading list
Go to my knowledge base, which will be coming up soon. I'll be developing it as a HTML page.


## Contact and connections
Soon enough I'll get enough savings to reopen my personal website.
